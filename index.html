		Whether it be through Roseanne or DopeSick, the media has begun to shed a light on the dark side of the prescription drug epidemic in America. This opioid epidemic has swept throughout the nation, leaving a trail of opioid addictions and overdoses since its introduction.

	<p> Beginning in the late 1990s, pharmaceutical corporations reassured doctors that opioid pain medications would not lead to addiction, and healthcare providers began prescribing them at higher rates. Opioids are often used to relieve pain because they connect to pain-blocking receptors in the brain and spinal cord. This pain blockade can also cause euphoria or a "high" feeling. It was and continues to be easy to become addicted to this high feeling, leading to drug misuse. Increased opioid prescriptions resulted in widespread abuse of both prescription and non-prescription opioids before recognizing that these drugs were highly addictive.</p>

	<p>Terry Shapiro, executive vice-president at <a href="https://gia.miami/">GIA Miami</a> and a member of the Palm Beach County Addiction and Recovery Task Force, described the trend of opioid addictions. He states that once opioid prescriptions are prescribed, ["patients] start to use and get physiologically addictive, meaning if you stop, you will have physiological withdrawal symptoms, diarrhea, stomach cramps, and the only way to stop is by using some more." </p>


	<p>While acquiring drugs from drug dealers and lower-income areas is still a significant issue in the United States, opioids differ in how medical professionals with high credentials prescribe them. As stated previously, many of these highly addictive opioids are prescribed to patients by their very own doctors to treat any pain. The origins of the opioid epidemic can be linked back to doctors' exploitation of these medicines to manage pain rather than seeking out other treatments. Because these medications are more commonly covered by insurance policies than alternative treatments and therapies, they are simply a no-brainer.</p>

	<p>To further support this information, the chart above analyzes the total number of prescription records for 11 common opioid drugs written by 25,000 distinct, licensed medical practitioners in the US for those insured by Medicare Part D. It is evident that the top prescribers come from medical specialties of Family Practice, Internal Medicine, and Nurse Practitioners. Family Practice leads specialties at around 257,000 prescriptions within a year, followed by Internal Medicine at 247,000 and Nurse Practitioners at 87,000. That means that the majority of these addictions come from primary care physicians.</p>

	<p>The opioid epidemic has also become an increasingly important topic as overdose rates have surged in the United States in just the last couple of years. The overdose rates in America from 2014 and 2019 can be seen in the two maps above. Using the data from the Medicare Coverage Part D plans and drug overdose data recorded by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, areas most common to these drug overdoses include states near or along the Eastern seaboard, like West Virginia and Delaware.</p>

	<p>Within just five years, the United States went from having one state (West Virginia) with an overdose death rate of over 30 to11 states in 2019. These numbers continued to skyrocket due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as more drugs, such as cocaine and marijuana, were, and continue to be, laced with the highly morbid opioid fentanyl. Fentanyl is a deadly synthetic opioid with a potency of fifty to one hundred times that of morphine. Shapiro describes how readily available these opioids have become, especially within the illegal drug scene in America. "It was oxycontin prescription drugs and heroin combined, and now almost 98% of the heroin is cut with fentanyl… It is super available, laced in marijuana and cocaine (fentanyl)... drug dealers that were selling other things in the past are now selling fentanyl because it is physiologically addictive from the first use, if you survive."</p>

	<p>This problem continues to grow and spread among particularly younger crowds, such as teenagers around the ages of 17-18. Today, over 70,000 people have died from opioid overdoses in America, with 10.1 million people misusing opioid prescriptions written for them. With an increase in misuse, there must be more information on how to combat this widely spreading epidemic. Shapiro describes substance use disorder as a chronic progressive, often fatal illness. “Like diabetes and hypertension, if you dont manage it on a daily basis, then they get hospitalized. If substance abuse patients, dont follow the path set for their road to recovery, the chance for them to return to the use of their substance of choice is pretty high.”</p>

	<p>Substance abuse is a brain disease, we dont know the cause, there is no cure, and it needs to be managed on a daily basis, whether that be through support or medical facilities. </p>
